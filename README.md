This is a game!  It's a puzzle, in particular.  Your goal is to rotate the pieces so that the lines drawn on them line up with those on adjacent pieces.  It can get pretty tricky!  Click to rotate clockwise (into the screen) or `shift`+click to rotate counter clockwise (out of the screen).  There are a couple of exciting puzzles available, and you can move between puzzles with the arrow buttons on the bottom of the screen.  And in case these aren't enough, press that big ol' plus button to you create your own puzzle.  Challenge your friends! Click into the void to make new pieces, double click to delete 'em, and drag to create connections between adjacent pieces.  (If you make one that you think is great, send me a screenshot?)

Also, it should try its best to save your progress, so if you come back at a later date, things should look the way you left them.

I hope you enjoy!  More puzzles and an even prettier interface to come, I promise.
